First and foremost, I would like to thank Prof. Theodoros Samaras for supporting and supervising this work in every milestone. In most publications and theses, there are usually some hidden heroes, and I consider it necessary to mention them here explicitly. One of the great merits of open knowledge and open-source work is the immediate and high-quality support provided by the community at any time; therefore, a great thanks goes to the community of all those anonymous users who helped with various technical aspects of the problem solving, either through forums or mailing lists. Apart from the actual technical work and analysis, the reviewing process also reassures the highest quality outcome. For that, I would like to explicitly thank my significant other, Electra Karakosta-Amarantidou\footnote{\href{https://gitlab.com/electronio\_volt}{https://gitlab.com/electronio\_volt}}, in supporting me and my work all along. Lastly, I wish to acknowledge everyone from the AcubeSAT\footnote{\href{https://acubesat.spacedot.gr/}{https://acubesat.spacedot.gr/}} project of the SpaceDot\footnote{\href{https://acubesat.spacedot.gr/}{https://acubesat.spacedot.gr/}} team, which I have been part of for the last three years, who helped me with issues I encountered. I hope all contributors have been given the deserved credit.
