\chapter{Simulation Results}

% The introduction needs restructuring because you have already written about this stuff in the general Introduction. I suggest you leave the introduction of each paragraph for the very end, where you will be able to read the whole text and create a better flow between the sections.
The scope of this work is to try and investigate the potential use of the \paper{Grossman}{Grossman2017} method on humans, while noting the road blocks of accurate simulation. Furthermore, since the method's effectiveness is heavily based on the injected current ratio and the electrode pair positioning, a discussion is provided in \autoref{sec:discussion} for potential optimization utilization. In the current section \paper{Grossman}{Grossman2017} approach with the spherical model is used as a benchmark for the validation of the software developed and the method is further extended for human models, where the results are seen in \autoref{sec:realistic_human_models}.

\section{Software Validation}

The simple spherical model is comprised of 4 layers in total, with varying thickness each. The layer thicknesses are included in \autoref{tab:spherical_layers} as fractions of the outer surface and stem from Grossman et al. \cite[Figure S2, J, and K]{Grossman2017}. Additionally, the conductivity values used in the paper are summarized in \autoref{tab:grossman_conductivity_vals}.

To benchmark the software developed for this work, the same electrode configuration as in Grossman \cite{Grossman2017} was used and the results are shown in \autoref{fig:grossman_thesis_comparison}.
% What are those results exactly? What are we seing in this figure?

It is clear from the figures above that the software can be considered accurate, based on the Grossman's results, so the analysis can proceed on the realistic human head models in the following section.
% Why is it clear exactly? They are similar but they are not identical, maybe you should be more specific on what criteria you are using. Also, I would prefer something in the lines of "Since we have established that the analysis and the corresponding software produce accurate results for the simple spherical model, we can proceed to apply it to the human brain model".

\section{Realistic Human Models}
\label{sec:realistic_human_models}

Manipulating a spherical model, then a murine model and finally a realistic human model comes at the cost of exponentially increasing complexity. Nevertheless, it consists an essential process, along with testing on murine models and phantoms, that has to precede in order to be able to validate any hypothesis during clinical trials.

In that direction, two key factors have been tested in this work, specifically the effect of the human head anatomy variation between subjects, as well as the variation of the electrode position. These effects are presented in \cref{subsec:effects_of_model_anatomy,subsec:varying_electrode_position} respectively. As it will be evident below, the anatomy of each patient has a significant impact on the resulting pattern inside the brain. Thus, there is the need for optimization to achieve stimulation of a small area, as different electrode pair combinations must be used for each person or model. This optimization will be the subject of a future work, however a relevant discussion is provided in \autoref{sec:discussion}.
% When you say electrode combinations you mean a differend brand? Different colour? Different position? Different stimulation?

Lastly, it should be noted that for the electrode positioning impact assessment models with the international 10-10 system have also been tested to find the potential issues that the 10-20 system's coarse nature might have. It should be noted that all conductivity values for the simulated models originate from the \gls{IT'IS} tissue database \cite{ITstissue}.
% What is the 10-20 coarse nature?

\subsection{Effects of Model Anatomy}
\label{subsec:effects_of_model_anatomy}

Assessing the impact of the model anatomy on the field distribution requires testing on many different subjects to have statistically significant results. Specifically, 9 models from the \gls{PHM} repository \cite{ErikG.Lee2016} having the 10-20 as the electrode placement system were used. Electrodes P8, F7 \textit{(1\si{kHz})} and P7, F8 \textit{(1.04\si{kHz})} were employed, with the first electrode in each couple being the active electrode. The corresponding electrode positions are shown in \autoref{fig:electrodes_10-20}.

    \label{fig:brain_slice_for_effects}
\end{figure}

As a first step, the electric field of the maximum modulation envelope was extracted across the x-axis for each model, with the reference plane illustrated in \autoref{fig:brain_slice_for_effects_x}. The extracted field values can be seen in \autoref{fig:x_axis_effect} along with the standard deviation in the legend.

    \label{fig:x_axis_effect}
\end{figure}

It is evident from \autoref{fig:x_axis_effect} that a similar electric field pattern is present across different models, at least ragarding the area around the center of the graph, but there is considerable variation in the normalized field intensity as well as the standard deviation. Furthermore, another measurement was conducted along the center of bounds axis (\autoref{fig:brain_slice_for_effects_cf}) and as illustrated in \autoref{fig:center_of_bounds_effect}, the preceding observations are even more prevalent.

    \label{fig:center_of_bounds_effect}
\end{figure}

Looking at \autoref{fig:center_of_bounds_effect} it is evident that for each model the variability of the electric field is not negligible. The graph indicates the values on the line that cuts the center of bounds for each model, meaning that is passes through many different layers at different heights in the head, giving a clearer picture of what happens. 

To better understand the cause of this difference and gauge which models have similar patterns, \gls{PCA} was performed with the features as summarized in \autoref{tab:pca_features}. For each model, the thickness was calculated from the coordinate points along the x-axis line (\autoref{fig:brain_slice_for_effects_x}), in the corresponding regions. Each of the maximum modulation envelope electric field was calculated in the whole volume of each designated region on \autoref{tab:pca_features}, same as the standard deviation.

Correlating the data from \autoref{tab:pca_features} in a \gls{PCA} chart, provides an insight on similarities or the lack thereof, between the models used. As seen in \autoref{fig:model_pca}, there is some clustering of models indicating that they more correlated than the rest, based on the provided feature set. That said, it is evident that the models 111716, 113619, and 163129 are clustered together, in a weak way, and as seen on \autoref{tab:pca_features} they have very similar thickness values. Models like 103414 and 110411 are on the 2 sides of the graph and they have very different thickness values. The two latter models have also significant difference in the mean electric field values on the white matter.

    \label{fig:model_pca}
\end{figure}

From the analysis provided above, it seems that there is a dependance on the thickness of the model with the final electric field sparsity and distribution, considering the same electrodes are operating for each one of the models. Despite the initial evidence presented above, further investigation with more models is required to reach a conclusion. What is certain is that there is a dependance on the model geometry and the final pattern as it can also be seen in \autoref{fig:models_pattern_variation}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.8\textwidth]{assets/images/brain_pattern_variation_models.pdf}
    \caption{Variation of the electric field pattern distribution for the different models. The scale is the same for all models.}
    \label{fig:models_pattern_variation}
\end{figure}

In all models included in this work and all simulations, a uniform white matter and skull are assumed. This is not the correct since the white matter has different regions with different densities, and similarly the skull has the spongiform regions with very low conductivity value. As shown by \paper{Rampersad}{Rampersad2013_skull_approximations}, on \gls{tES} and specifically \gls{tDCS}, the different conductivity values for the layered bone structure \textit{(spongiform and compact bone)} of the skull can have a considerable effect if not considered in the simulations. The white matter uniformity consideration on the other hand, provides no information for the different regions and it puts a road block on assessing the impact of the electric field on the regions of interest, most of them lying in the white matter region, near the ventricles \textit{(e.g., pineal gland and globus palidus)}.

\subsection{Varying Electrode Position}
\label{subsec:varying_electrode_position}

Model anatomy is one of the crucial factors that must be considered when simulating with \gls{tTIS}. Although it is not the only player, since the current ratio between the two electrodes, and the position of them, can influence the results a lot.

As shown by \paper{Rampersad}{Rampersad2019}, the current ratio has significant impact regarding the maximum potential achieved in a given volume. This dependance is well explained as shown in \autoref{fig:mod_env_amplitude_var}, due to the fact that when the two electrodes are not placed symmetrically, the pair closest to the region of interest takes over. The resulting modulation amplitude is much lower than the one seen in \autoref{fig:modulation_showcase}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{assets/images/modulation_envelope_2-1.pdf}
    \caption{Modulation envelope and the effect of differing amplitudes between the two fields}
    \label{fig:mod_env_amplitude_var}
\end{figure}

In this work, the attention will be shifted towards the electrode position variation and its subsequent effects. One can imagine that moving the electrodes or changing the combination used can have an impact on the final pattern. It is evident from \autoref{fig:elec_position_variation} that using the combination just one step above the previous one can have significant impact on the field distribution.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.49\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{assets/images/105014_26_16.png}

        \label{fig:26_16_elec_pair}

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Electric field distribution with varying electrode position}
    \label{fig:elec_position_variation}
\end{figure}

Even if one electrode is moved and the others stay as they are, significant differences are observed \textit{(\autoref{fig:one_elec_moved_var})}. One of the main reasons making \cref{fig:26_16_elec_pair,fig:25_15_elec_pair} differ significantly is the lack of granularity the 10-20 system provides. Limited only to 19 electrodes, there is not much room for movement, hence a system with more electrodes is required and in that case th 10-10 system can be a good candidate. The reason that the 10-5 system is not considered is mainly due to the very high number of electrodes \textit{(329 in total)}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.49\textwidth}

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Electric field distribution with varying electrode position}
    \label{fig:one_elec_moved_var}
\end{figure}

As it will be discussed in a more detail in the \nameref{sec:discussion}, the dependance on the position, the current ratio, and the model anatomy drives the need for seeking personalized optimization for each model. The optimization will be part of future work and it is not covered in the current work.

To better illustrate the granularity mentioned above, the \textbf{103414} model was meshed with all the 10-10 system electrodes and the solved with the pairs as shown in \autoref{fig:one_elec_moved_var_10-10}.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.49\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width = \textwidth]{assets/images/103414_35_68_43_76.png}
        \caption{FT7, P7 and FT8, P8 electrode pairs.}
        \label{fig:35_68_43_76_elec_pair}

    \caption{Electric field distribution with varying electrode position on the 10-10 system.}
    \label{fig:one_elec_moved_var_10-10}
\end{figure}

What is clear from the figure above is that the effect the electrode position on the electric field pattern can be manipulated with more refined moves.
