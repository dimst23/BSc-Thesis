abstract = {TetGen is a C++ program for generating good quality tetrahedral meshes aimed to support numerical methods and scientific computing. The problem of quality tetrahedral mesh generation is challenged by many theoretical and practical issues. TetGen uses Delaunay-based algorithms which have theoretical guarantee of correctness. It can robustly handle arbitrary complex 3D geometries and is fast in practice. The source code of TetGen is freely available.This article presents the essential algorithms and techniques used to develop TetGen. The intended audience are researchers or developers in mesh generation or other related areas. It describes the key software components of TetGen, including an efficient tetrahedral mesh data structure, a set of enhanced local mesh operations (combination of flips and edge removal), and filtered exact geometric predicates. The essential algorithms include incremental Delaunay algorithms for inserting vertices, constrained Delaunay algorithms for inserting constraints (edges and triangles), a new edge recovery algorithm for recovering constraints, and a new constrained Delaunay refinement algorithm for adaptive quality tetrahedral mesh generation. Experimental examples as well as comparisons with other softwares are presented.},
